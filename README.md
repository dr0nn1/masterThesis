## About
A system developed using machine learning to detect a person falling into the water.  
The system uses a custom YOLOv4-tiny model as an object detection model and deep SORT as an object tracker.  
The goal of the system is to detect and report if a person falls into the water, and in this way reduce the number of drowning accidents.
